## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps
[Arc](https://arc.net/)
- Super well designed onboarding with an experience unique to other apps
- General attention to small design details
- Easy to customize browser themes 

[Notion](https://notion.so)
- Accessible across all my devices

[Spotify](https://spotify.com) 
- Handoff music playback from one device to another
- Easy to find enjoyable playlists based on my mood + what I've listened to
- App is faster/more responsive than others I use on a daily basis

### App ideas
- App that uses your calendar to find out how much free time you have and how much time you spend in events on each calendar per week.
- A app that helps you maintain relationships by periodically reminding you to contact a randomly selected friend you haven't talked to in a while.
- An app for when you wake up late. You tell it when you’re about to leave, and your desired location, and it’ll play a metronome letting you know what pace you need to walk in order to make it to class on time 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
